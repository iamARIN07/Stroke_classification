Classification problem on predicting Stoke patients

A stroke is an interruption of the blood supply to any part of the brain. If blood flow was stopped for longer than a few seconds and the brain cannot get blood and oxygen, brain cells can die, and the abilities controlled by that area of the brain are lost. In this Notebook we will use some features to see wether we will be able to predict the stoke or not.
